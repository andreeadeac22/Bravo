Usage:

./Visualiser <dbname> <tilewidth> <tilesx> <tilesy>

* <dbname> is the name of the postgres database in which the tile data is stored
* <tilewidth> is the (integer) width of a tile in the database, (for example 128 means that the tiles were loaded as 128x128)
* <tilesx> is the number of tiles stored in X (i.e. the width of the stored scene) to load
* <tllesy> is respectively the height. 

If the database is called "bravodb", and there are 33x33 tiles each containing 128x128 heights in the database;

./Visualiser bravodb 128 33 33

Dependencies:
